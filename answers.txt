Merging is when you are trying to get two different branches together. For example, you branch off the main branch and work in your new branch. When you want your changes to go back to the main branch, you call a git merge to merge the changes to the main branch. Rebasing is kind of the other way around. When you are in your new branch and you need to merge changes from main or another branch into your new branch, instead of doing a merge, you a do a rebase. You are able to get the changes from a later commit onto your new branch.
